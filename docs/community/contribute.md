# Contribution guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Ragna!

All Ragna development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/Quansight/ragna).

If you'd like to contribute to an existing issue, make sure to comment on the issue to
communicate your interest. If you're interested in something new, open an issue first to
express interest and discuss the topic, implementation details, etc. with the Ragna
Development Team.

## Local development setup

To contribute to any part of the Ragna codebase (which includes documentation) you can
setup a local development space with the following instructions.

### Fork and clone the repository

You can refer to the GitHub documentation on how to
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and
[clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
repositories.

Quick reference:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ragna.git
```

### Set up development environment

We recommend using conda, but you can use any package and environment manager you
prefer. The `environment-dev.yml` file at the root of the project lists all the required
development dependencies.

Create and activate a conda environment:

```bash
conda env create --file environment-dev.yml
conda activate ragna-dev
```

### Setup pre-commit hooks (optional)

To maintain code standards, you can install some pre-commit hooks that check your
contributions when you commit them:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

These checks are also run in the CI on each pull request.

## Contribute code

You install Ragna in editable mode to test your contributions locally as you develop:

```bash
pip install --editable '.[all]'
```

Verify that a development version is installed with:

```bash
ragna --version
# Ideal output: ragna <version-number> devXXXX from ...
```

## Contribute documentation

Ragna uses the [Di√°taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) and the
[Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/) to
author documentation, [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the documentation
website, and [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ragna/) to serve the
website.

You can contribute to narrative documentation by adding and updating files in the `docs`
directory.

<!-- TODO: Add notes on contributing examples once we decide the workflow -->

To start a development build of the website that auto-refreshes on new changes, run the
following from the project root:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This serves the docs website at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Contribution best practices

- Before opening new issues, go through the tracker to ensure there aren't any previous
  issues related to your topic.
- Write clear and descriptive issues and include all the necessary context like library
  versions and the complete error traceback.
- Eagerly communicate if you are interested in contributing to any open issues.
- To contribute new features and enhancements, open issues to discuss the work before
  creating a pull request.
- Make sure to test your pull request locally, and include relevant unit tests and
  documentation.
