## Governance

All project decisions are made by the Ragna Development Team, and typically involve a
discussion (during meetings or through an RFD) followed by a vote.

The current Ragna development team consists of members from Quansight LLC, who supported
the initial development of Ragna. Community members with valuable contributions to the
projects can be nominated and added to the Ragna Development Team.
