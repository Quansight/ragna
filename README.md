## `panel`

The main component in the UI is the chat box. It will get a significant revamp in `panel==1.3`. However, until that is released, we need to install from source and in particular from the [`chat_components` branch](https://github.com/holoviz/panel/tree/chat_components). Fortunately, `panel` contains no compiled parts and thus it is as easy as

```
pip install git+https://github.com/holoviz/panel@chat_components
```
