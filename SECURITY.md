# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support only the latest version, and we use [SemVer](https://calver.org/) for versioning which means minor version are backwards compatible.

You should feel comfortable upgrading if you're using our documented public APIs and pay attention to `DeprecationWarnings`. Whenever there is a need to break compatibility, it is announced in the [Changelog](docs/references/changelog.md) and will raise a `DeprecationWarning` before it's finally really broken.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, please report it at [ragna/security](https://github.com/Quansight/ragna/security).
